###### Hint 1: Orbitcontrols 

When working with lights,  it's helpful to add `<OrbitControls />`    
This allows you to **rotate, zoom, and pan** around the robot to see how it looks from different angles.

See how `<OrbitControls />` is added in the <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/pbwi6i" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Drone Example</a> and do the same.


After that,  
try adding other light-related components and see how they affect the scene.


Keep up the great work! üëè
