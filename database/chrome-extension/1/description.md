###### Milestone 1: Initial setup

There are many ways how to code a chrome plugin, but I just used <u>[this template](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react)</u>


It's basic
built with webpack & react and has all the pages pre-built for you. 
What pages? What is happening? Will handle that in Milestone 2

So go ahead and set it up and add the extension to chrome, the github link has all the info you need.

By the end you should have something like this:
![Project 1](/chrome-extension/image15.png "What we will be making")
 Replace with a video after it.


**Todo:** 
- Setup the project using the boilerplate
