###### Hint 1: Same but diffrent

You will need to work on `Popup.jsx` & `index.js`   
This task is really similar to **milestone 9** that we just had

`Popup.jsx`   
We add the slider & update the domainChange value 

`index.js`  
We set the default values & use the domainChange value


**Dont forget ðŸ’¡**    
Every time we **re-open** the popup, we need to load the **new** value.
