###### Milestone 2: Understanding the template

You probably got the same message as me when you opened a new tab.

<video width="640" height="48" controls preload>
  <source src="/chrome-extension/m2-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Let's fix/remove that! ðŸ˜Š  
By that I mean disable `newtab.html` being the default when opening a new tab in Chrome.  
Doing this will help us learn about how the template works. You can also poke around the other pages as well to see how everything works.

**Tip ðŸ’¡**  
If you update the `manifest.json` & `index.js` in the background folder, you need to refresh the plugin manually by clicking this:

**Task âœ…**
- Disable `newtab.html` as the Chrome new tab page.
