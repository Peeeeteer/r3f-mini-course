###### Milestone 9: Choose Category

Now that we display a question, btw cool & good job. ðŸ˜Ž  
Let's allow users to choose a category and show a random question from that category.

Basically this:
<video width="640" height="480" controls preload>
  <source src="/chrome-extension/m9-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


**Task âœ…**
- Add category filter
- Show a random question from that category.
