###### Hint 3:  Watch tutorials.

Watch tutorials... yes I said it.

I know,  
this is against the JustCode policy, but... watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=github+clone+project" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">how to clone github</a>

Some other things you can watch are:

- How to clone a github repository
- How chrome plugins work
- What is a development environment?
- React Basics
