btw,  
I went with the Vite version

**2. Optional**  
I also added tailwindcss for styling.  
To add tailwindcss to vite (react) project, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite#react" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow these instructions:</a>


A lot of words,   
by the end of it, you should have something like this. 
<img src="/robot-landing/image1.png" alt="index.js" width="860" height="620">

The Hello world is with tailwindcss by doing
```javascript
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
      Hello world!
    </h1>
```
