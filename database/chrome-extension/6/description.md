###### Milestone 6: Open a newtab

It might not seem like it,  
but the main function is finished. 

➡️ we count changes ➡️ we count to 10 ➡️ we do something… 

<br>

Now,  
let’s improve the plugin even more by opening the `newtab.jsx` page instead of `console.log("bingo")`  
You will also need to update `newtab.jsx` to include a button that says "continue" when clicked it takes the user back to the previous page. 

<br>

This is what I basicly mean:
<video width="640" height="480" controls preload muted>
  <source src="/chrome-extension/m6-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>




**Task ✅**
- Instead of `console.log("bingo”)` open `newtab.jsx`
- Add a button that says “continue” that redirects back
