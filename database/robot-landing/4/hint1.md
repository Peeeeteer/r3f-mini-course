###### Hint 1: Read again and again

This is not easy, so take it slow.  
Really make sure your read everything <a href="https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/your-first-scene" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">line by line in the documentation</a>

<br>

Also some things to consider.

**1.**  
You will only be working in the `App.jsx` file right now.

**2.**  
Double check that you didnt forget to install `three` & `@react-three/fiber  `

# Install 
```bash
cd your-app-name
npm install three @react-three/fiber
```

# Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```


ðŸ’ª You got this ðŸ’ª
