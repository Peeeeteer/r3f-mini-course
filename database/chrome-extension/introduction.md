##### Introduction:

You will build a chrome extension that helps you with your addictions.
You will track domain changes and open a quiz after a certain amount and when the user answers, continue browsing… of course you can change that to be anything else you want!

Basicly, we will be building this. VIDEO INSTEAD OF IMAGE
![Project 1](/chrome-extension/image11.png "What we will be making")


**You will do it the justcode way**
- 10 milestones
- each milestone has 3 hints

The milestone will have a brief description and you need to try to solve them any means possible, either by googling,using ai, watching a video or  just solving it on your own…


##### Requirement/Difficulty

We will be working with: 
* **React**
* **Tailwind CSS**

I would consider this to be **“EASY”** difficulty.     
If you know a little React & Tailwind you should be all good, but **If** this is your first time touching Javascript or React then it will be a little harder.

Basically,     
This shit is **free…** just try it man. You literally have nothing to lose.
