###### Milestone 7: Annoying problems

While I was browsing some Chrome documentation the popup showed up... Annoying 😒😒😒  
<video width="640" height="480" controls preload muted>
  <source src="/chrome-extension/m7-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


Let's fix it. 👨‍🔧   
Create an on/off button to prevent new tabs from opening when the plugin is off.

Basically like this:
<video width="640" height="480" controls preload muted>
  <source src="/chrome-extension/m7-2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

**Task ✅**
- Make an on/off button 
- No new tabs, while off
