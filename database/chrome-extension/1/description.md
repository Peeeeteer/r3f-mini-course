###### Milestone 1: Initial boilerplate setup

There are many ways how to code a chrome plugin, but I just used <a href="https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this template </a>  

It's built with webpack & react and has all the pages pre-built for you.     
What pages? What is happening? Dont worry... we will handle that in Milestone 2


So for now,  
Go ahead and set up <a href="https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">the template/boiler plate</a>

By the end you should have something like this:
<video width="640" height="480" controls preload>
  <source src="/chrome-extension/m1-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>



**Task âœ…**
- Setup the project using the boilerplate
