###### Milestone 5: Combining things.

Currently we show the newtab every 10 domain changes,  
Lets allow the users to choose how often they want to see the quiz show up.

So you should have something like this:
<video width="640" height="480" controls preload>
  <source src="/chrome-extension/m10-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


**Task âœ…**
- Create a Slider that controls how often the quiz shows up.
