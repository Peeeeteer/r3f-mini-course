###### Milestone 2: Cube

Lets goo!

📄 **From this:**
<img src="/robot-landing/image1.png" alt="index.js" width="860" height="620">

➡️ **To this:**
<img src="/robot-landing/image9.png" alt="index.js" width="860" height="620">


We can do this by 
<a href="https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/your-first-scene" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following the documentation</a>

This is now going to be easy if this is your first time using R3F so take your time.  
Transform the default setup we started with into a version that includes an input field and displays a list.


**Tip 💡**  
You can use any tool to help you solve this issue, whether its google/ai/youtube... the goal is that you have a 3D cube in the center.


**Task ✅**
- Remove everything that unneeded from App.jsx
- Add a simple cube scene from `"your-first-scene"`
