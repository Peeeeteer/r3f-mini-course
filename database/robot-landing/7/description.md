###### Milestone 7: More buttons 

Cool!  
We have progressed a lot. 👏👏

This next milestone will be a little harder...  
At least for me personally so take your time with this one.

We want to basicly make this:
<video width="640" height="480" controls preload>
  <source src="https://bq46iimbxf.ufs.sh/f/d6oWbqcM0NRhU7j7O73Ri0LhEWfj6sp5bCPcBr8DQIZkl279" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

We will be adding 2 more buttons  
Those 2 buttons each have a different facial expression. (Cry,Star)

We should be able to scroll down to each button with the robot remaining in the middle


Use anything and everything that can help you to do this.(AI,Google,Youtube etc..)

Important:  
The `<Orbitcontrols />` still need to work, by that I mean that we can rotate the robot around.


**Task ✅**
- Create 2 more buttons
- Each button has its own facial expression (cry,star)
