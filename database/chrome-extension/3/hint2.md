Play around with the values in `Popup.jsx` and `Popup.css` to see how they change the popup.

It's completely okay to use Youtube/Google/AI,  
as long as:

- **1.** Solving a specific problem
- **2.** Understand how it was solved  

This way, you won't be stuck in `tutorial hell`  and you will continue learning and building projects.  
So go ahead and try finding some info; here is a search term that can help:
