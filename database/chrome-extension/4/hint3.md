###### Hint 3: Stackoverflow


<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34957319/how-to-listen-for-url-change-with-chrome-extension" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">This stackoverflow thread</a> is 8 years old but all info is still relevant. 


But this is how I would start it.  
index.js (in background folder)
```javascript
chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener((tabId, changeInfo, tab) => {
    // Lets do something here.

});
```

ðŸ“Œ **DONT FORGET!** ðŸ“Œ  
To allow your plugin to access tabs and interact with URLs,  
you'll need to enable the necessary permissions in the `manifest.json` file mentioned in the stackoverflow thread
